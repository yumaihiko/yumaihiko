# 💫 Welcome to FishFish's World

## Hello, I'm Fishhh 036 ✨

Welcome to my corner of the digital world. Here I craft ideas into reality through code, with every line of script written with passion and purpose.

### 🎮 What I Do

I'm a passionate developer specializing in **Lua scripting** for **FiveM plugin development**. There's something magical about bringing interactive experiences to life, and that's where my heart truly lies.

### 💻 My Toolkit

I work with several languages, each serving its purpose in my creative journey:

- **Lua** — My primary language for FiveM plugins (where my passion shines brightest ⭐)
- **Python** — For automation and data processing
- **JavaScript** — For web-based projects
- **HTML** — Building the visual foundation
- **MySQL** — Managing data with precision

### 🌟 My Journey

Every project I undertake is infused with dedication and care. Whether it's designing intricate FiveM systems or solving complex problems, I approach each challenge with enthusiasm and commitment to excellence.

### 💝 My Inspiration

Everything I create is driven by the love and support of the most important person in my life—**Emilie Cheng**. You are my greatest source of motivation and joy. Thank you for believing in me, for being my light, and for making every day brighter. 💕
